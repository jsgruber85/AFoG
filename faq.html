                                ‘A Fifth of Gaming’ (AFoG) is a tool for organizing a recurring online multiplayer video game night. It handles game selection, session scheduling, player info, attendance tracking, and email reminders.

                                It’s easier for people with busy lives to set aside time to get together and play a game if there is a set schedule known in advance. I created AFoG because I kept having conversations with friends and colleagues that ended with “Yah, we should totally play that together sometime!” but never translated into actual playtime.

                                AFoG will automatically schedule sessions once every five days at the time-of-day specified by the guild creator at creation. The goal of the pace is to be frequent enough to be a routine part of your schedule but rare enough to not infringe on other important parts of life. This pace also ensures that the day-of-the-week on which game night falls is constantly changing, so scheduling conflicts for a player with other obligations on certain days of the week will hopefully be minimized. The constant cadence of the pace allows people to know when the sessions will be as far in advance as they want.

                                Clicking on a session record will open the Details view, which shows all players who attended the session. An Admin looking at this view for the most recent session will also see the list of active players who were absent from the session. An Admin can move players back and forth between the “Present” and “Absent” lists by simply clicking on their names. All players present for a session earn 1 AP.

                                AP stands for “Attendance Point”. Players earn 1 AP whenever they attend a Session and use those points to exert their own influence on what games the group plays. A player’s vote during game selection is weighted by how much AP they currently have, and AP can also be used to increase or decrease the number of sessions remaining on the current Game. The purpose of AP is to ensure that the people who are the most active participants in game night are the people who have the most input about what games are played.

                                The very first game is selected by the person who creates the guild at the time of creation. All future games are selected by the guild players. As soon as one game cycle starts, AFoG automatically takes the guild through a three-phase selection process that includes nomination, voting, and results. By the end of this process, the next game has been selected and added to the schedule.

                                During the Nomination Phase, all members of the guild can add 1 game to the list of games players can choose from during the Voting Phase. AFoG is integrated with the Internet Game Database (IGDB) API, so the nomination page allows a user to search for a game by typing in its name. The search tool automatically excludes unreleased games, single-player games, and non-PC games.

A detailed round-by-round results page can be viewed to see exactly who voted for what games in which rounds, when each game was eliminated, and how much AP each player spent.
